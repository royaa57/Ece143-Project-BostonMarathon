In file 'Pace Change 2016'
We compare the pace change every 5K between all runners and top 100 runners to see the difference 
and try to give suggestion about how runners can run better. 

As we can see in the plot that it is distinct that all runners' pace change more violently while 
top runners' pace change narrow. So we get the conclision that keep your pace steady is very 
important in Marathon Game and you are more likely to get better grades.





In file 'Pace Comparison between 2015-2017'
In this programming, we want to compare the pace change nearly every 5k and try to get some conclusion 
about how runners should adjust their pace to win the Marathon with more possibility.

Some feature:

Results are in minutes
Time for each splits of nearly 5km

The first plot is 'Pace change between 2015-2017', and from this plot we can see that both males and 
females' pace change is steady, after 25K to 35K, runners' pace change more violently which may related 
to the topography reason that Boston Marathon route is steady in the first half and really curve and 
twisting in the second half, and there’s a famous “Heartbreak Hill” which starts at around the 32 
Kilometre mark. One interesting point is that through our data analysis, we can see that from 35K to 
Final, females' pace change reduced while males' pace change increased which we infer that maybe males
just use all their power at the beginning of their run and so when they close to the final, they just do 
not have enough energy to spurt.

The second plot is 'All runners pace change during three years' which we can obviously see that runners
perform better in 2015 which we infer may related to the weather because the weather in 2015 Marathon 
was colder and maybe colder weather can produce better performance for Marathon.
