We explore the reasons that may influence negative split

First Figure:
Plot the split ratio distribution. 
That is, the time ratio between the first and a second half of the race. 
A value smaller than 1 implies a negative split - i.e, the 2nd part of the race was faster than the first one. 
And inversely, a value which is larger than 1 indicates the more intuitive (and evidently more common) positive 
split. We only care about the meaning of horizontal axis and ignore vertical axis.
As we can see, most of the runners chose (or were compelled to choose, limited by the constraints their body 
imposes upon them) a positive split. They run the 2nd half slower than the first half. for most of them, 
however, the difference is small and they are able to maintain a relatively constant pace. There's a long tail
on the right of runners who slowed down significantly. On the left we can see a small minority of runners who 
did in fact run a negative split.
Second Figure:
Overall Rank correlates with the splits:
The better runners have a more negative (or less positive, to be more accurate) than worse runners.
Third Figure:
males vs females:
The Average is very close, but the longer tail of the males distribution skews it to the right.
Forth Figure:
Split changes with age:
We can see these five distributions virtually overlap.
So we can quite conclusively say that the split rate is not age dependent.


In file 'split and performance'
Let's see whether split correlates with the general performance:
We can see that while the general trend does show a very moderate increase in the split ratio with the overall rank 
(that is - the lower the runner is ranked, the more positive his or her split is). However, the most dominant trend 
is the growing variance: while the good runners are all concentrated around a split of, say, 1.2, the worse runners 
are all around the place.
